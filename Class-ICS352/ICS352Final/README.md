# ICS 352 Final Questions. Note not all questions are included as many were multiple choice, but rather help explain the methodology of the coding I used for the questions given.

# Question 1:
An excel file contains data about Titanic passengers, it includes information about passenger name, class, sex, age, ticket, cabin, and survived.
1. Use the decision tree classifier from Scikit Learn to predict whether a passenger survived or died in the tragedy.
2. Plot the decision tree.
3. Use KNN from Scikit Learn to predict whether a passenger survived or died in the tragedy. Run the model for different values of K.


# Question 2:
Scikit-Learn sklearn.datasets has the wine dataset in load_wine loader:
1. Show the classes of this data, the features of this data, and the number of the dimensions in this data, and how many samples this data has.
2. Split the data into training set and testing set, and implement the Bayesian classifier on this data and calculate the accuracy
3. Split the data into training set and testing set, and implement K Nearest Neighbor on this data and calculate the accuracy. try several values of K and pick the one with the best accuracy
4. Split the data into training and testing and implement the K-Means Clustering on this data and calculate the accuracy. Try several values of K and pick the one with the best accuracy.
5. Split the data into training and testing and implement the Decision Tree on this data and calculate the accuracy.

Question 3:
The parity problem returns 1 if the number of inputs that are 1 is even, and 0 otherwise. 
1. Can a perceptron algorithm learn this problem for 3 inputs? Design the network and try it.
2. Using Scikit-Learn show how the perceptron will learn this problem
3. Using Scikit-Learn show how the multi-layer perceptron will learn this problem
